# Computing Mod-5 Galois Images of Torsion on Abelian Surfaces

This repository contains code for computing the mod-5 image of the Galois Representation for the Jacobian of a genus 2 hyperelliptic curves.
The algorithm is described in the paper "Computing Mod-5 Galois Images of Torsion on Abelian Surfaces" by Andy Zhu, Mathilde Kermorgant, and Aidan Hennessey.
All code provided is written in Magma.
Note that the primary implementation relies on Andrew Sutherland's [Smalljac](https://math.mit.edu/~drew/smalljac.html) and this may require separate configuration.
An alternative (but much slower) method is provided which does require Smalljac.
